Implementation of a secure cache architecture in SystemVerilog

This project implements a hardware-level cache-partitioning architecture designed to mitigate cache-based side-channel attacks. It builds upon the advanced material *Implementing Cache Controllers* from *Computer Organization and Design* by Hennessy and Patterson [Advanced Material: Implementing Cache Controllers](https://booksite.elsevier.com/9780124077263/downloads/advance_contents_and_appendices/section_5.12.pdf). The original direct-mapped cache controller was extended to a set-associative configuration with an LRU replacement policy and an additional flush function. During this development, some ideas were inspired by the work of Ferrari and Mazzeo [2-way-Set-Associative-Cache](https://github.com/AndreaMazzeo289/2-way-Set-Associative-Cache).

The defense mechanism implemented on top of this architecture is based on the Dynamically Allocated Way Guard (DAWG) concept proposed by Kiriansky et al. [DAWG](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/418). This work introduces policy bitmasks and domain identifiers that regulate cache hit and miss behavior, enforcing isolation between protection domains. The domain identifiers also ensure that processes cannot flush cache lines outside their assigned domains.

The design was implemented in SystemVerilog and verified using testbenches and waveform simulations, demonstrating effective prevention of cross-domain cache interference. However, the results also reveal cache coherence challenges, as multiple domains may hold modified copies of shared data. These findings highlight the trade-off between isolation and coherence in secure cache design. Future work could focus on hardware-driven coherence handling and dynamic domain management, to further decouple hardware security mechanisms from software and reduce software complexity.
